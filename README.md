# \[WORKSHOP\] Manuscript Transmission as Speciation: Using Agent-Based Models and Bayesian Inference

This repository contains the necessary code for the workshop dedicated to using agent-based models and Bayesian inference to simulate manuscript transmission. 

It introduces a new python package, called [simMAtree](https://github.com/LostMa-ERC/simMAtree), currently in development by the LostMA project team. 

The workshop is divided in two parts: 
  - Simulations using agent-based model (`agent_based_models.ipynb` file, [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LostMa-ERC/simMAtree_workshop/blob/main/agent_based_models.ipynb))
  - Inference using Simulation Based Inference (`simmatree.ipynb` file, [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LostMa-ERC/simMAtree_workshop/blob/main/simmatree.ipynb))
