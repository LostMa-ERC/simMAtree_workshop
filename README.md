# \[WORKSHOP\] Manuscript Transmission as Speciation: Using Agent-Based Models and Bayesian Inference

This repository contains the necessary code for the workshop dedicated to using agent-based models and Bayesian inference to simulate manuscript transmission. 

It introduces a new python package, called [simMAtree](https://github.com/LostMa-ERC/simMAtree), currently in development by the LostMA project team. 

You'll find the most relevant information in the `main.ipynb` file.
